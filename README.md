# Image_Classification
Performed Image Classification using different CNN Architectures.

**Problem statement**   
We have a multi-class classification problem at hand, the images are of Diabetic retinopathy retinal images which are classified into 5 classes as follows :   
no apparent retinopathy - 0   
mild non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR) - 1    
moderate NPDR - 2    
severe NPDR - 3    
proliferative diabetic retinopathy - 4    
**End goal** - Build an image classification model to classify a given image.    

In this Notebook, I have followed many good practices such as handling class imbalance and used Image Augmentation also. Currently uploaded the notebook with VGG16 as the feature extractor but it is pretty straight forward to use other CNN architectures with/without pretrained weights to achieve the task. (will upload the rest soon).

Since the size of dataset is huge I have not uploaded, but its publically available.
